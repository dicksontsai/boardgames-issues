## Jeopardy

### UI
There seems to be a dark & light mode going on.

While dark mode works well, light mode uses a gradient background and the text in the answer is black.

### Audio
The new chime clashes with the following sounds:
1. Wrong answer triplet
2. Double Jeopardy board refresh
3. Potentially the Final Jeopardy tune as well

### Misc
On Firefox as a player, sometimes the answer does not reveal itself when the host triggers it. To reveal it, I have to scroll the page.
